That, which does not exist, can hardly be blogged about. What if something exists, but, as the Kena Upanishad (Verse 3) says: 

>  The eye does not go there, nor speech, nor mind. We do not know That. We do not know how to instruct one about It. It is distinct from the known and above the unknown. We have heard it so stated by preceptors who taught us That

Here the great Rishi seems to say that it is hard to even talk about the absolute Truth. 

Yet, in this blog, I am venturing into this small but audacious attempt to talk about That. I am so puny that I can't do it justice. But, I am too powerless to desist as well. So, I am certainly going to talk about this in this blog. But for the most part, I would use this as a travelogue to speak about some holy wanderings in this ancient land of ours - my beautiful India. 

Most of my ruminations are concentrated around Hinduism which is the religion that I am brought up with and that I am the most familiar. But I do think that all paths reach the same abode. Some are however, longer than the others. But as someone said, even the weariest river should someday,  wind its way down to the sea. The same applies to human beings too. We all walk in our own rambling sort of way - towards the goal of self knowledge.

In the _Vedas_ and more importantly in the Upanishad portion of the Vedas (aka Vedanta - i.e. the end of the Veda), most of these profound truths have been revealed. 

In most scriptures, the greatest ruminations and utterances have been clothed in so much symbolism that it is sometimes impossible to strip them of the surrounding raiment to understand the treasures underneath in their full glory. Not so the Upanishads. They get to the point with the pin point precision of a well directed missile. They pierce through the armor and reveal us for what we are. 

But in this world of micro blogs, people are obsessed with TL;DR; (Too Long did not read). Our great seers seem to have anticipated them as well! They condensed the Upanishads into really small "swallowable" capsules called the _Mahavakyas_.

The _Mahavakyas_ literally "great sentences" attempt to summarize the purport of the Vedas. _Aham Brahmasmi_ is one such mahavakya which literally means "I am Brahman". What is Brahman and what this sentence means would probably be the entire purpose of this blog or for that matter the purpose of any religious scripture!!

On that note.. I end this intro. Shivoham! Hari Om!
