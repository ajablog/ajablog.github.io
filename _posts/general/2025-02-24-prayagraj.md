## Prayagraj 

Kumbh literally means a pot. In this case, it figuratively indicates the pot of Amrit or nectar of eternal youth that had been painstakingly churned from an ocean. In a more spiritual context, this symbolises the ocean of knowledge (of Brahman) that leads a person to immortality - i.e. the realisation that we are indestructible, eternal, immanent, pure and ever-blissful. This realisation is experiential and needs to be done individually. It cannot be inferred from reason or experienced by the sense organs. 

We need to partake this knowledge. Kumbh provides one of the conduits. It brings together the worldly and the spirtual souls in one place and helps catalyse this process.The Kumbh provides us an opportunity to meet the great solitary souls who come to this place only during this time.

## Merger of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswathi

To the Hindu, there is nothing holier than the Ganga. The merger of Ganga and Yamuna is a merger of opposites. Symbolically, it is interpreted in multiple ways such as the fusion of mind and body, Atman and Paramatman and a harmonious blend between the spiritual and the ephemeral. 

It can also be interpreted as the merger of the Triguna (three energies of nature - Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas). I have a hypothesis about the mythical Saraswathi river which [I have documented here](/history/2008/09/19/triveni-sangam.html). Anyways, let us move on to today's destination which is Prayagraj.

## The Kumbh Area
 
The Kumbh area can be reached from Ayodhya in multiple ways including road and train. We took the road and was able to brave the incessant traffic and road closures by fine-tuning our route so that we could directly reach the Sangam area. Google Maps needs to be supplemented here with a local knowledge of all the gullies in this area. This required me to pay substantial money to just navigate around the barricades and reach the Kumbh area in time. In short, we paid for a manual version of Google Maps.

The Sangam area in Prayagraj had been built as a temporary city using ephemeral roads, tents, lighting structures and makeshift bathrooms. 

There was provision for multiple stores, tea shops and restaurants. Lots of well known Hindu organizations such as ISKCON, Isha Foundation, Sri Sri Foundation etc.  have set up their camp in the area. This entire area is on one side of the Ganga river.

## The Ghats

On the other side, the Kumbh mela spans large and wide like an all-encompassing ocean of humankind. 
We had to walk a few kilometers to get there. But once there, it was mind blowing to see the crowd and their fervour. 

People streamed to the area across narrow bridges to join the big crowd there somewhat akin to small rivulets joining a massive river.

Old, young, even sick people were gushing there like an unstoppable tide.

Men, women and children use the multiple ghats that cover the area to take the much acclaimed river dip. An overview of the Snan Ghats

The place resembled a fair ground strewn with purveyors of everything from joy camel rides, food stuff, beads and other things, shawls and spiritual aids such as Rudraksha, conch etc. We are not sure if some of them were rolled out from factories or manufactured using 3D printers. But we have it all here.

The constant presence of the Police gave the comfort of some security amidst the chaos. But this is India - it thrives in disorder. It is hard to enforce too much order when the number of visitors at any time outnumber that of any living city in the world and when the total number of piligrims over 40 odd days exceed the population of most countries.
