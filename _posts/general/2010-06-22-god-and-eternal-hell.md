Eternal hell always worried me. It brings with it associated images of unbridled punishment. No amount of penitence would suffice to efface the bad deeds that lead you to this pathetic condition! It is like you are in front of a vengeful God who decides to spare nothing out of his omnipotence to wreak the maximum damage on you. And the best part is that he was the one who was supposed to have created you in the first place and hence directly or indirectly responsible for all your misdeeds - a weird conundrum indeed! It is almost like God did a bad job of creating you and does not want to take responsibilit. There are a few problems with such a proposition. One is that God is considered "All-Knowing" and hence incapable of creating an imperfect being. The second is that God is considered Perfect and hence would take accountability for his actions which is the least he can do. Third he is considered "all-merciful"! To me, an all merciful God is simply antithetical to an eternal hell. Eternal Hell smacks of irrepressible tyranny.

So in my mind we have two options to choose which are mutually exclusive - one is the option of an All-Merciful, Omnipotent,Perfect God and the second is eternal hell. I would choose the first option and be done with it! The second one simply makes no sense.

But what happens to the prevailing imperfection? If God is All-Knowing, why would he create beings with so many vices to their credit! The law of karma is much better at explaining this seemingly contradictory phenomenon. It just tells us something what is morally compatible with our ethics. It makes an individual responsible for his own deeds so that we don't have to fabricate eternal hells to exact vengeance on "bad" people. This law is more like a "law of physics". It is impartial and applies universally. No prophet can "save" a person. He has to reap the rewards of his past Karma - irregardless. A law like that seems more "impartial" and does not smack of nepotism.
