## Gaya
Gaya is an important Vishnu Kshethram for Hindus. Gaya is named after the demon Gayasura who lived in the area during the Treta Yuga. According to Vayu Purana, Gayasura became pious after strict penance. Vishnu came and blessed him. It was said that the body of Gayasura was transformed into the series of rocky hills that make up the landscape of Gaya.

The Gaya Sharda is one of the most important Hindu rituals that we aspire to perform during our lifetime. It is an offering to our ancestors. It is an opportunity for remembrance for ancestors, in-laws, other relatives, friends and whoever we think are important.

We headed to the banks of the Phalgu river to offer the Pinda-daan. This is in keeping with the tradition that Lord Rama set up by doing the same for his father Dasharadha Maharaj. 

The Vishnu temple here is very imposing with 50 kgs of Gold adorning the top.

## The Panda Menace
The Pandas here who adorn this temple are probably the very worst. They are aggressive, uncouth and literally force you to fork out huge amounts for various things in the name of earning merit. We had to deal with them and managed to come out relatively unscatched.

## Bodh Gaya
Bodh Gaya is the place that contains the tree under which Buddha was said to have attaoined Nirvana. It is a must visit. Unfortunately, we could not take pictures since camera is strictly not allowed.

## Back to Bangalore
We took the flight back to Bangalore via Calcutta. This Yatra gave us amazing memories.

Har Har Mahadev! Vishnave Namaha !
