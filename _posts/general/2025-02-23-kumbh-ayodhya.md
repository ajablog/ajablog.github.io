## The Lure of the Kumbh

Kumbh holds a special place in the heart of the Hindu. The [2025 version of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Prayag_Maha_Kumbh_Mela) is specially significant due to a special alignment of the Sun, Moon and Jupiter - an event that happens once in 144 years i.e. once for every 12 Mahakumbhs (each Mahakumbh happens once in 12 years). Wiser souls than me have already waxed eloquent on the benefits of a dip in the Ganges during this time. It also has its share of the inevitable critics who look askance at a large mass of people who gather in one place spreading all kinds of diseases. Hinduism has no dearth of its protoganists and detractors. 

But the tradition prevails. The Kumbh acts like a divine magnet. Some come there to get a chance to see the Naga Sadhus. Others arrive to cleanse themselves of their sins. Some others reinvigorate themselves by a glimpse of this amazing faith which drew so many people into one place. Some others turn up to ply their wares to the multitude. Some people sense an opportunity to rip others off their hard savings and capitalizing on their gullibility. It does not matter what your motivation is. People of faith get drawn to it like moths to a flame. 

As far as I am concerned God is everywhere. God wont be constrained to dine only at expensive hotels or visit beautiful places. God is completely unencumbered and if I cannot find God in a humble dwelling in a dump then it is myfaith that needs to be questioned and not God.

So accordingly, we felt that our Shivarathri in Feb 26, 2025 will be better spent in the company of Shiva Bhakthas at Kashi during Kumbh time. We get to see the Naga Sadhus, get a glimpse of the Lord of the World (Vishwanath) and hobnob with souls who have come here in pure faith. In short, we wanted the whole deal. Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Gaya and of course Kashi are the places that we wanted to visit. 

## Ayodhya 

We decided to see Lord Rama in the first leg of the trip. 

Accordingly, we started our journey from Bangalore and flew to Delhi from where we boarded the Vande Bharat express to Ayodhya. The train provides us a comfortable journey with a meal to boot. So, after a burp, a yawn and a catnap later we reached Ayodhya.

We camped there at a modest hotel which bombastically called itself Ramay palace. We preferred this due to its proximity to the Ram temple. The place provides a decent accommodation for a modest price.

After a quick refresh, we headed to the Ayodhya Ram temple. It is up a hillock offering beautiful views of multiple temples and the inevitable ruins. 

You will see a Ramanuja charya mutt as you climb the hill.

As you climb further, you will see other interesting places such as this.

Then there are some beautiful temples and structures that come into view.

## Kanaka Bhavan 

You can reach a place called Kanaka Bhavan after a modest walk of about 20 minutes. 
Kanaka Bhavan is supposed to be the palace of Lord Rama.

It is a big building with a spacious courtyard.

From the courtyard, you move to an inner sanctum that is adorned with images of Lord Rama and his consort Sitaji's. They are absolutely beautiful.

As an ardent Mahadev worshipper, I was thrilled to see my beloved Shiva in a small and beautiful temple of his own which was outside the main Kanaka Bhavan.

## Dasharadh Palace

We proceeded forward to goto Dasharadha's palace. Dasharadha is the father of Lord Rama. The palace had the idols of Shri Rama from different times of his life. It had images of him before and after exile. The idol becomes dark after exile. Presumably, the artist want affect even on Lord Rama.

## Hanuman Garhi

You don't see Lord Rama without seeing Lord Hanuman referred callously by the detractors as Monkey God. Lord Hanuman represents the most subtle form of Bhakti. You don't see the infinite without the requisite reverence. It is equivalent to going to a cool party without the dress code. So you should see Hanuman before you see Lord Rama. As expected, Hanuman Garhi was incredibly crowded.

We found a kid who could navigate us through the temple (for a fee of course) and took us straight inside for an incredible darshan. It was awesome.

## Ayodhya Main temple 

The main Ayodhya temple beckoned to us from there. It was an amazing experience to be able to get a darshan of the Lord with waves of incantations of "Jai Shri Ram" from the swelling tide of humanity. We were lucky to get access to the VIP darshan. It was the most amazing thing to see Lord Rama's idol. Unfortunately, I could not click any pictures since cameras and cell phones are prohibited within the premises. 

As we bid adieu to this beautiful place, we clicked an idol of Young Lord Rama who reminds me of similar idols of Young Krishna.
