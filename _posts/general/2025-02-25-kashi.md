## Kashi & Shiva

Varanasi or Kashi or Benares is the oldest continuously inhabited city in India and truly in the world. Wikipedia lists the oldest date of Kashi as 1200 BC but this is based in the way that the Westerners have dated Indian antiquity. Varanasi finds mentions in the Vedas and Puranas and can be 1000s of years older than originally attributed to it.

This city of Shiva - at the confluence of the Varuna and Asi rivers - is an amazing leveller. It defies any attempt to classify it. It has the most evolved and the most primitive things. It sees erudite priests battling with seeming simpletons. It sees a beautiful celebration of life in the most hopeless of deaths. 

Shiva is the Lord of destruction according to the Hindu Trinity. Yet, he is also the ultimate giver of life and symbolises everything that is sentient in the Universe. It is said that what is untouched by Shiva is Shava (a corpse).

So, when you walk into Shiva's city, you can expect anything. You can go there to buy the best Benarasi Silk , take a dip in the polluted Ganga, see a beautiful Ganga Arathi while smoking weed or sipping a lassi (sweet butter milk) laced with Bhang (weed). Everything is acceptable. 

Shiva graces the city. His abode is in the heart of the city at the Kashi Vishwanath temple - where he is literally the King of the entire Universe. He also doubles as a security guard (Kshetra Palaka) to Kashi in his form as Kala Bhairava which literally means that he is the ruler of Time. So as a ruler of Space and Time, Shiva escorts you every step of the way in Kashi. 

He is hailed as Bholenath - the God who grants everyone's wishes. Of course, as an Advaintin, I try to stay away from any wishes. God is not a transactional partner. 

## The Hotel

We stayed at a heritage hotel called Guleria Kothi which is the only place to be at Kashi. They had extortionist prices for Kumbh but you simply need to stay there to get the best experience of Kashi. The hotel can only be approached via boat. They provide a boat service from Namo Ghat. So we hopped into an auto rickshaw at the Varanasi Jn station and were on our way to Namo Ghat. Namo Ghat is the newly christened name (if christened is the word I want in referring to Kashi) for Raj Ghat. (incidental pun for Narendra Modi is perhaps not intended ;) )

Outside Name Ghat there is a tomb dedicated to someone whose name I forget but presumably had a role to play in the plundering of this city. The tomb itself looks great.

You then see a beautiful image of Namaste inside the Ghat.

The boat offers amazing first vistas of Kashi.

We finally make it to the hotel which has recently been renovated as well.

## Manikarnika

Sati was the first consort of Shiva. Her father Daksha is too materialistic to like Shiva. Daksha performed a yagna to which Shiva was not invited. Sati argued with Shiva that he does not need any special invite and comes to the Yagna despite Shiva's warning to abstain from coming there. In the Yagna, Daksha direspects Shiva to such an extent that Sati decided to end her life. 

Shiva is so dejected to see Sati's body that he carries it to Himalayas and starts dancing with it. Vishnu wanted to put a stop to Shiva's antics and cuts the body to pieces. There are 51 places where the body was supposed to have fallen and these are called the Shakti peeths today. In Manikarnika, Sati's earrings fell. Earrings are called Manikarnika in Sanskrit and that is how the place got its name. 

Manikarnika is a Shakti Peeth and a perpetual crematorium. Bodies burn non-stop 365 days a year. Getting cremated here is supposed to provide a straight conduit to Moksha. In fact, it is considered unlucky to count the number of bodies that are getting cremated at any time.

## Visit to Manikarnika & The Naga Sadhus

We set out on Feb 25 2025 to walk towards Manikarnika and see some Naga Sadhus on the way. They have moved from Prayagraj to Kashi for Shiva rathri which is on Feb 26 2025. We walked along the banks of the Ganga river and saw some Naga Sadhus. Hinduism is the only non strait-jacketed religion that truly believes that there are multiple paths towards Moksha, God or the Supreme being. (Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti as the Rig Veda says). The Naga Sadhus and Aghoris stretch this statement to the maximum. There is literally no limit to the means that these people use to attain the Supreme.

Many of them wander into myriads of byelanes and probably miss the main goal. But it is arrogant to assume that they are wrong. The Supreme works in mysterious ways - its wonders to perform. 

Anyways, we saw all kinds of Naga Sadhus - some people flaunting their nudity, other sporting sunglasses and yet others waving their staffs, daggers and peacock feathers at us. Many of them manage to hit us. Others missed but it is not for want of their trying.

Manikarnika has some beautiful temples with its own Shakti and Shiva rituals. The rituals tend to be tantric and are performed by Aghoris and Naga Sadhus.

## Shivarathri - evening & morning

As evening turned to night, the crowds started swelling even more. The peaceful banks of Ganga became even more dotted with people. Many of them came to take a dip at the Ganga but others brought water from various places to give a Snan (bath) to the Almighty Shiva himself. Shiva, after all, has this reputation of accepting anything from anyone if offered with true Love.

As dusk lead to dawn on the Shivarathri day, there was no sign of ebbing in terms of the crowd anywhere. Many of these people spend their life savings to come here. What we do is nothing when compared to those sacrifices that they endure.

## Vishwanatha & KalaBhairava Darsanam

The darshan of Lord Vishwanatha happened on the day of Shivarathri (Feb 26 2025) at 8 30 am. We were able to short circuit the queue (thereby inconveniencing a lot of people which I regret) by giving money to some people. But the darshan was glorious. I learnt later that people have been in the queue for a darshan for more than 10 hours sometimes. All glory to them and I stand ashamed for short circuiting this process and promoting corruption.

Kalabhairava darsanam took place on the 27th of February - the day after Shiva Rathri. We were lucky to have the darshan in this crowd. But unfortunately I don't have pics to show for it since they prohibit cameras and cell phones in these areas.
