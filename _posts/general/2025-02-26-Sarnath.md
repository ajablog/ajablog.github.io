## Sarnath

A king came hunting for deers. A male deer was ready to sacrifice itself for a female deer. The king was so impressed by this gesture that he made the whole place a deer sanctuary where deers will be protected. This came to be known as Sarnath - after Saranganatha which translates to "Lord of the Deer". 

Sarnath is the first place where the Buddha preached his new religion to his disciples. There are three places to see here 
1. The Dhamek Stupa
2. The Buddha temple and statues
3. Museum

## Buddha temple
We started with the Buddha temple which has a big Buddha idol in it. This is the Mahayana form of Buddhism where the Buddha himself is worshipped as a God - quite in contrast to his original teachings.

The park surrounding this temple has a 80' 9" Buddha. This represents the 80 years of Buddha's life and the 9 months he was at his mother's womb.

There are replicas of the original lions of Ashoka which became the Indian National emblem afterwards.

## The Dhamek Stupa
This is considered as one of the eight most important piligrimage sites for the Buddhists. It is a solid cylinder of bricks and stone reaching a height of 43.6 meters and having a diameter of 28 meters. It was originally erected by Ashoka.

After Buddha's death, his body was cremated and his ashes were buried in eight places. This is supposed to be one of them.

The whole place consists of beautifully manicured lawns leading up to a great structure of imposing height and width.

## The Museum
The museum hosts a lot of pieces from different eras that have been unearthed in this area. It also gives a quick glimpse on life during the ancient times and the co-existence of multiple religions in the area. 

There is a mixture of multiple idols from the Hindu and Buddhist traditions mostly.
